' First real-execution test harness for the PowerPoint-hosted modules
' (Discovery, InjectPrimitive, Matching, Resolve, SyncOperations,
' Onboarding). Every prior SPIKE_NOTES_*.md said "not executed or verified
' in this environment" -- this module exists to close that gap for real,
' driven headlessly via COM automation (see the PowerShell driver script),
' not by a human clicking through the Immediate window.
'
' Deliberately NOT the same as the ManualSmokeTest* subs already in each
' module: those use MsgBox, which would hang a headless script waiting on a
' click that never comes. Every Test_* function here is a pure assertion
' function -- returns "" on full pass, or one "FAIL: ..." line per failed
' assertion otherwise -- so RunAllTests can produce one machine-readable
' report with no human present.
'
' Fixture strategy: most tests build their own slides/shapes programmatically
' (deterministic, no dependency on a fixture file's exact geometry surviving
' across PowerPoint versions). Two tests still open a real test-fixtures/
' file directly (shp-groupshape.pptx, for its real 4-way sibling-ambiguity
' geometry, which would be needlessly fragile to reproduce by hand) --
' `fixturesDir` is that folder's path, passed in by the driver rather than
' hardcoded, since the real repo path isn't necessarily reachable the same
' way from a Windows-hosted COM session (see the driver script for how
' fixtures get staged).
